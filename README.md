# CA682: Data Management and Visualisation

Code and analyses for CA682 module.

## Data

Data will be hosted on Google Drive.

## Finding weather station data

Met Ã‰ireann provides access to historical data via their [website](https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data).
The interface provided allows a user to download a dataset for one weather station at a time.
However, for this project we require much more data, and would like all data for all weather stations.

Using the inspection tools in Chrome I found a `stations.csv` file that was being loaded.
Some fields of interest here were the station name, county, latitude, longitude, and most importantly, the assigned station number.

I then found a base url where the historical data was hosted.
By manually downloading a single dataset and examining the URL, I was able to determine the form of the URLs for the hosted data:

`"$BASE_URL"/dly"$STATION_NUMBER".zip`

## Cleaning up `stations.csv`

There is a lot of information that we don't need in `stations.csv`.
This file can be tidied up to extract only the fields of interest by running `clean_stations_csv.sh`.
This is a very simple shell script.
The contents are shown below:

```
$ cat clean_stations_csv.sh
#!/bin/bash
# extract fields of interest from `stations.csv`

# directory containing the input file `stations.csv`
data_dir=$1

# the name of the input file
input_file="$1"/stations.csv
# the name of the output file
output_file="$1"/stations_clean.csv

# add the header to the output file
echo "station_number,station_name,county,latitude,longitude" >"$output_file"

# extract the first five fields of the input file, skip the original header
# and append the rest to the output file
cut -d',' -f1-5 "$input_file" |tail -n+2 >>"$output_file"
```
